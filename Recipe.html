  <h1>Recipe of my favourite  food</h1>
  <h2> Why it is my favourite?</h2>
  <p> Biriyani is basicaly a mixed rice dish which can be prominently seen in Indian subcontinent. 
      It consist of rice, meat, sometimes vegetables and egg. But being this my favourite dish is because
      we use Indian spices for the prepration in which it makes this dish extreamly flavourful and aromatic. 
      Meat includes either chicken, goat, beef, lamb, prawn or fish which is also the prime ingredient with rice. 
      The spices and seasonings used in biryani include ghee, pepper, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, bay leaves, 
      coriander, mint leaves, ginger, onions, tomatoes, green chilies and garlic. The premium varieties
